## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Learners
1. Visit the [live website](https://summaw.github.io/learn-puppeteer)
2. Start with the "Getting Started" section
3. Work through each tutorial at your own pace
4. Copy and modify code examples for your projects

### For Developers
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://summaw.github.io/learn-puppeteer.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. **Open locally**:
   ```bash
   # Open with a local server (recommended)
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Or simply open index.html in your browser
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Scroll to "Pages" section
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Click "Save"

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Examples
1. Edit the relevant HTML file in the `pages/` directory
2. Add your code example within the tabbed interface structure
3. Update the JavaScript in `main.js` if needed
4. Test locally before pushing changes

### Styling Changes
- Modify `css/style.css` for visual customizations
- The CSS uses CSS custom properties (variables) for easy theming
- Responsive breakpoints are already configured

### JavaScript Functionality
- Tab switching logic is in `main.js`
- Code copy functionality uses the Clipboard API
- Notification system for user feedback
